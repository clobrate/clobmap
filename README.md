# clobmap

A minimalistic, cross-platform mind-mapping app where the **YAML view and the mind-map view are equally first-class**. Edit either; the other follows.

Built with **Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript**. Targets macOS, Windows, Linux, web, and (later) iOS / Android.

> **Status:** Phase 9 / 15 — desktop auto-update plumbing in place. App checks for updates on launch (30s) and once per 24h; an in-app banner offers Install & Relaunch with signature verification. Release runbook at [`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md). Live at https://clobmap.com.

## What it does today

- Edit a mind map as **YAML** (CodeMirror 6, syntax highlighting, inline parse errors).
- View / edit the same map as a **horizontal tree** (React Flow + Dagre layout).
- Toggle between **YAML / Split / Mind-map** in the header (or `Cmd/Ctrl + /`); split shows both panes side-by-side.
- Edits in either view propagate to the other; selecting a node in the canvas jumps the YAML cursor to its line.
- YAML comments and field ordering survive structural edits made from the canvas.
- Open / save mind maps as `.clobmap.yaml` files (plain `.yaml` / `.yml` also opens); recent files persist across launches; external edits are detected and reloaded.
- **Auto-save** (toggle in the ⚙ menu): when on and the YAML parses cleanly, edits flush to disk after a short pause.
- **Split orientation:** side-by-side (default) or stacked, switchable from the ⚙ menu — preference persists across launches.
- **Theme:** system / light / dark, follows OS by default; **font size:** slider in ⚙ menu (10–24 px); both persist across launches.
- **Keyboard-only operable:** arrow keys navigate the canvas (Up/Down siblings, Right child, Left parent); the tree is announced to screen readers via ARIA `role="tree"` / `treeitem`.
- Runs **as a web app** too — `npm run build:web` outputs a static `dist-web/`. Save uses the File System Access API on Chromium and falls back to download elsewhere; Tauri-only features (file watcher, native dialogs) downgrade gracefully.

## Run it

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20 — for the frontend toolchain.
- **Rust** (stable) — for the Tauri runtime. Install via:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS) — for the system linker.

### Dev (hot-reload)

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

A native window opens with the editor. Edit `src/**/*.tsx` and the running app hot-reloads.

### Production build (desktop)

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Bundles land at:

- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/clobmap.app`
- `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/clobmap_*.dmg`

### Production build (web)

```bash
npm run build:web        # outputs dist-web/
npm run preview:web      # serve it locally on http://localhost:4173
```

`dist-web/` is a static SPA bundle — drop it on any static host. The repo includes a `_redirects` (SPA fallback) and `_headers` (cache + security) file that Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and similar hosts pick up automatically.

**Deploying to clobmap.com via Cloudflare Pages:**

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare → Pages → Create project → connect the repo.
3. Build command: `npm run build:web` · Output directory: `dist-web` · Node version: 20.
4. Add `clobmap.com` as a custom domain. Cloudflare will ask you to point DNS — easiest is to change the DreamHost nameservers to Cloudflare's (Cloudflare runs DNS, DreamHost remains the registrar).
5. Add `www.clobmap.com` as a redirect to apex.
6. Every push to `main` redeploys; every PR gets a `*.pages.dev` preview.

## Use it

The app starts with a sample mind map. Use the **YAML / Split / Mind-map** toggle in the header (or `Cmd/Ctrl + /`) to switch views.

**App-wide shortcuts**

| Action                               | Shortcut               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Cycle view (YAML → Split → Mind-map) | `Cmd/Ctrl + /`         |
| Open file…                           | `Cmd/Ctrl + O`         |
| Save                                 | `Cmd/Ctrl + S`         |
| Save As…                             | `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S` |

The header **File** menu mirrors these and lists up to 10 recently opened files.

The window title shows `● <filename> — clobmap` while there are unsaved changes; closing the window prompts before discarding them. If the open file is modified externally (e.g. via `vim`) the app reloads it; if you have unsaved edits, it asks first.

### YAML view

A standard text editor with YAML syntax highlighting.

| Action          | Shortcut                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Undo / redo     | `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` / `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` |
| Indent / dedent | `Tab` / `Shift + Tab`                   |

When a node is selected in the mind-map and you switch to YAML or Split, the editor's cursor jumps to that node's line.

The status bar at the bottom shows `Valid` / `Invalid: line N — message` and a dirty indicator.
Invalid YAML keeps the **last valid mind-map** rendered — your work isn't lost while you're mid-edit.

### Mind-map view

| Action                           | Shortcut                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select a node                    | Click                                                                        |

| Add a child                      | `Tab` (auto-renames)                                                         |
| Add a sibling                    | `Enter` (auto-renames)                                                       |
| Rename inline                    | `F2` or double-click                                                         |
| Delete                           | `Delete` / `Backspace` (root is protected)                                   |
| Collapse / expand                | `Space`, or click the `▸/▾` chevron on the node                              |
| Move selection — sibling         | `↑` / `↓`                                                                    |
| Move selection — into children   | `→` (auto-expands collapsed nodes)                                           |
| Move selection — to parent       | `←`                                                                          |
| Reparent (drag)                  | Drag a node onto another (illegal drops snap back)                           |
| Reparent (cut/paste, long range) | `Cmd/Ctrl + X` on source, select target, `Cmd/Ctrl + V`                      |
| Context menu                     | Right-click — Rename, Edit note, Set color, Add/Duplicate, Cut/Paste, Delete |
| Fit to view                      | `Cmd/Ctrl + 0`                                                               |
| Undo / redo                      | `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` / `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` (or `Cmd/Ctrl + Y`)                  |
| Cancel edit / clear clipboard    | `Esc`                                                                        |

Mind-map mutations preserve YAML comments and field ordering wherever possible (via in-place AST surgery, not full re-serialization).

## File extension

Mind maps are saved as **`.clobmap.yaml`**:

- The trailing `.yaml` keeps every YAML-aware tool happy — vim, VS Code, GitHub, `git diff`, and other editors apply YAML syntax highlighting automatically.
- The `.clobmap.yaml` compound suffix lets the OS register clobmap as the handler for _just_ mind-map files (registered in the installer in Phase 10) without hijacking every `.yaml` file on your machine.
- Plain `.yaml` / `.yml` files still open — the format is unchanged, only the recommended filename differs.

## YAML format

```yaml
title: My mind map
version: 1
root:
  id: n1
  text: Central idea
  children:
    - id: n2
      text: Branch A
      children:
        - id: n3
          text: Leaf
          children: []
    - id: n4
      text: Branch B
      note: An optional longer description
      color: "#3b82f6"
      collapsed: false
      children: []
```

| Field on a node | Required              | Notes                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | yes                   | Stable identity. Auto-generated as `n` + base36 counter for new nodes. |
| `text`          | yes                   | The label shown on the node.                                           |
| `children`      | no (defaults to `[]`) | Array of child nodes.                                                  |
| `note`          | no                    | Hover tooltip on the canvas.                                           |
| `color`         | no                    | Hex string used as the node's border color.                            |
| `collapsed`     | no                    | When `true`, descendants are hidden in the mind-map view.              |

Top-level fields:

- `title` (required) — document title
- `root` (required) — the single root node
- `version` (optional) — schema version, currently `1`

## Roadmap

Implementation plan in [`implementation-plan.md`](./implementation-plan.md). One phase = one logically-complete release with hard exit criteria. ✅ = shipped.

| Phase | Status | What it adds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Contributing / dev notes

- Don't commit secrets, build artifacts, or `node_modules` — `.gitignore` covers the standard set.
- Phase commits land on `main`. Run `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `build` before committing.
- Coverage on `src/model/` is gated at 90% (lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Keep this README current — every shipped phase updates the [Roadmap](#roadmap) and any user-facing behavior tables above.
